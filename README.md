# Johns_Hopkins_COVID19_Data_Project
Simple data analysis project as part of CU Boulder's MS Data Science Program

This project was written in R. Both a .pdf and .rmd file are included in this repository.

This project aims to briefly identify trends of Covid19 cases and deaths in the United States across time. Several visualizations were utilized to demonstrate the changes in both cases and deaths in both the US and the state of Massachusetts. As the reported cases and deaths tended to plateau in 2022, further visualizations were created to highlight the changes in new cases and new deaths. Comparisons of deaths per thousand people and cases per thousand people were made across each state. Lastly, the relationship between cases and deaths per thousand was modeled by using deaths per thousand as a function of cases per thousand.
